Wild Mountain Thyme
===================

1.        G      C    G       
   O' the summer time has come
           C                 G       
   And the trees are sweetly bloomin'
           C    G        Em   
   And the wild mountain thyme
         C          Am       C      
   Grows around the bloomin' heather
           G  C      G  
   Will ye go lassie go?

Ch.           C      G                C    G        Em

    All around the bloomin' heather, will ye go lassie go?

2. I will build my love a bower
   By yon cool crystal fountain
   And round it I will pile
   All the wild flowers o' the mountain.
   Will ye go lassie go? (...)

3. I will range through the wilds
   And the deep glen sae dreamy
   And return wi' their spoils
   Tae the bower o' my dearie.
   Will ye go lassie go? (...)

4. If my true love she'll not come
   Then I'll surely find another
   To pull wild mountain thyme
   All around the bloomin' heather.
   Will ye go lassie go? (...)


Whiskey in the Jar
==================

Irish traditional

1.    C                       Am                        
   As  I was a goin' over the  far famed Kerry mountains
     F                                 C                     
   I  met with Captain Farrell and his  money he was counting
                                    Am                      
   I first produced my pistol and I  then produced my rapier
          F                                                 
   Saying  "Stand and deliver, for you are a bold deceiver!"

Ch.        G                      
    Mush-a  ring dum-a do dum-a da
    C                    
     Whack for me daddy-o
    F                    
     Whack for me daddy-o
            C        G       C   
    There's  whiskey  in the  jar

2. I counted out his money and it made a pretty penny
   I put it in me pocket and I took it home to Jenny
   She sighed and she swore that she never would deceive me
   But the devil take the women for they never can be easy
   Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da (...)

3. I went up to my chamber, all for to take a slumber
   I dreamt of gold and jewels and for sure 't was no wonder
   But Jenny drew me charges and she filled them up with water
   Then sent for captain Farrell to be ready for the slaughter
   Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da (...)

4. 'Twas was early in the morning, just before I rose to travel
   Up comes a band of footmen and likewise captain Farrell
   I first produced me pistol for she stole away me rapier
   I couldn't shoot the water, so a prisoner I was taken
   Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da (...)

5. Now there's some take delight in the carriages a-rollin'
   And others take delight in the hurling and the bowling
   But I take delight in the juice of the barley
   And courting pretty fair maids in the morning bright and early
   Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da (...)

6. If anyone can aid me 't is my brother in the army
   If I can find his station in Cork or in Killarney
   If he'll go with me, we'll go rovin' through Killkenny
   I'm sure he'll treat me better than my own a-sporting Jenny
   Mush-a ring dum-a do dum-a da (...)


Danny Boy
=========

English ballad

1. G7       C                   C7        F      
   Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
                C         Em       F        G7  
   From glen to glen, and down the mountain side
                C                 C7           F    
   The summer’s gone, and all the  flowers are dying
                  C        Dm     G7     C    
   ‘Tis you, ’tis you must go and I must bide.

Ch. 1. G7          Am        F        G7     C     
      But come ye back when summer’s in the meadow
                  Am       F          Em         D7   G7
      Or when the valley’s hushed and white with snow   
                   C       F              C  Am  
      ‘Tis I’ll be here in sunshine or in shadow.
               C             F      G7       C  
      Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so.

2. And if you come, when all the flowers are dying
   And I am dead, as dead I well may be
   You’ll come and find the place where I am lying
   And kneel and say an ”Ave”  there for me.

Ch. 2. And I shall hear, though soft you tread above me
      And all my dreams will warm and sweeter be 
      If you’ll not fail to tell me that you love me
      I’ll sleep in peace until you come to me.


Handsome Molly
==============

U.S. Old-time

1. G                   
   I wish was in London
                         D   
   Or some other seaport town
   D                          
   Step my foot in a steamboat
                      G    
   And sail the ocean round

2. Sailing round the ocean
   Sailing round the sea
   I’d think of Handsome Molly
   Wherever she may be

3. I saw her at church last Sunday
   She passed me on by
   I knew her mind was changing
   By the roving of her eye

4. Her hair as black as a Raven’s
   Her eyes were black as coal
   Her teeth shown like lilies
   Out in the morning cold

5. Now do you remember Molly
   When you give me your right hand
   Said if you ever married
   I’d be your man

6. Now you’ve broke your promise
   Go marry whom you please
   My heart is broken
   ‘Til I get some ease
