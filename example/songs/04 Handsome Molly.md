# Handsome Molly
## U.S. Old-time

1. `G`I wish was in London
Or some other seaport `D`town
`D`Step my foot in a steamboat
And sail the ocean `G`round

2. Sailing round the ocean
Sailing round the sea
I’d think of Handsome Molly
Wherever she may be

3. I saw her at church last Sunday
She passed me on by
I knew her mind was changing
By the roving of her eye

4. Her hair as black as a Raven’s
Her eyes were black as coal
Her teeth shown like lilies
Out in the morning cold

5. Now do you remember Molly
When you give me your right hand
Said if you ever married
I’d be your man

6. Now you’ve broke your promise
Go marry whom you please
My heart is broken
‘Til I get some ease
