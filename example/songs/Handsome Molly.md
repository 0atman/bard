# Handsome Molly
## U.S. Old-time

1. `G`I wish I was in London
Or some other seaport `D`town
`D`I'd step my foot on a steamboat
And sail the ocean `G`round

2. While sailing round the ocean
While sailing round the sea
I’d think of Handsome Molly
Wherever she may be

3. I went to church last Sunday
She passed me on by
I knew her mind was changing
By the roving of her eye

4. Her hair as black as a Raven’s
Her eyes were black as coal
Her teeth just like lilies
Out in the morning cold

5. Now do you remember Molly
When you gave me your right hand
Said if you ever married
Then I’d be the man

6. Now you’ve broke your promise
Go marry whom you please
My heart is broken
‘Til I get some ease
